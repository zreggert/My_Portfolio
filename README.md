# Zachary Eggert: Full Stack Developer Portfolio

## Description
This is my personal portfolio page I built to showcase projects I have worked on in my journey to become a full stack web developer. In it is my brand statement, projects both solo and collaborative, and contact information to get in touch with me as well as links to my online presence.

Below is a screen of my portfolio page.
